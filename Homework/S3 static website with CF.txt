Homework:
Create hosted zone on route53 for name-surname.devopsaca.site domain (f.e. gabovyan), send the ns records and name-surname to the thread of this meesage
Create s3 bucket with the domain name
Create cloudfront distribution with s3 origin
Create route53 records to point domain to the cf distribution
Put simple ibdex.html file to the bucket


1. Route 53 -> Create hosted zone
Domain name = lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site
It created 2 records, NS and SOA.
NS record has the following DNS servers as value:
ns-245.awsdns-30.com.
ns-1330.awsdns-38.org.
ns-1563.awsdns-03.co.uk.
ns-543.awsdns-03.net.


2. S3 -> Create bucket with the same name 
lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site

with public access on

2a) upload simple index.html file as if it is a static website
2b) go to properties -> static website -> enable
2c) policy
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1700851382479",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1700851380445",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site",
                "arn:aws:s3:::lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

3. Make sure that the website is hosted on S3 successfully
http://lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

4. CloudFront -> Create distribution
origin = S3
changed to website origin
click create
started Deploying

5. Make sure that the website is deployed successfully
http://d1c2w5ld7eyuv5.cloudfront.net

6. Route53 -> click on lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site -> Create Record
add A record, so that the root domain refers to the alias to CloudFront d1c2w5ld7eyuv5.cloudfront.net

Record name = empty (so that we have root domain)
Record Type = A
Alias = enabled
Route Traffic to = Alias to CloudFront distribution
Distribution = d1c2w5ld7eyuv5.cloudfront.net

7. After Gevorg will register my appropriate sub-domain in namecheap, I will see my website here:
http://lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site





Conclusion about result:
1. I created my static website in S3, publicly available
http://lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
2. Then I wanted to host it in CloudFront to make it without any latencies for the whole world. 
CloudFront deployed it here:
http://d1c2w5ld7eyuv5.cloudfront.net/
3. As I have my own domain lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site, I want my website to open under it.
That's why I open Route53, I created a DNS A record with Alias to CloudFront domain.
And after that my website in CloudFront is being available under this domain as well:
http://lusine-avanesyan.devopsaca.site/
